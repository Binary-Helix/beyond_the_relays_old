 EMPIRE_DESIGN_mec_asarirepublics_civ:0 "Asari Republics"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_mec_asarirepublics_civ_desc:0 "The unique culture of the Asari is predisposed towards peaceful coexistence, centrism in politics and compromise in conflict. While the Republics have never achieved a global government and remain a collection of indepentent states to this day, the Thessian civilization has flourished in relative peace and stability throughout most of its long history.\n\nThat does not, however, make the Asari blind to the dangers of the universe or helpless in the face of opposition. To the contrary: keenly aware of the value of their many achievements and secrets, they have no qualms about using diplomacy, deception and force alike to safeguard them."
 START_SCREEN_MEC_ASR:0 "We are the [Root.GetName]. Despite our history of diversity and divisivness, we have always found a way to understand each other, avoid major wars, protect our citizens from crime, disease and famine. One of our most defining achievements was the construction of a sophisticated communications infrastructure which has enabled every [Root.GetSpeciesName] to have a voice in the many e-democracies that make up our society.\n\nTogether we have built wonders, created beautiful art and developed advanced technologies. And we are not finished yet - our culture will define the galaxy for millenia to come. When other sentients look upon something in awe, we want them to think of us.\n\nYet the universe is vast and even we are very little next to infinity. We must remember that there is still much we don't know and not all of it can be trusted or reasoned with."
 
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_mec_asariillium_civ:0 "Illium Corporate Interests"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_mec_asariillium_civ_desc:0 "Illium Corporate Interests operate out of Illium, a young (by asari standards) colony, owned and governed by the private sector rather than the Asari Republics proper. The corporations on Illium enjoy almost unlimited legal latitude, infamously resulting in abusive labor practices and legalization of nearly everything except murder.\n\nIt is, however, far from lawless. The CEOs, celebrities and other powerful parties who have a stake in Illium's market are very particular about protecting their interests; omnipresent surveilance and extensive bureaucracy ensure that nothing and no one brings trouble to the decadent paradise."
 START_SCREEN_MEC_ASI:0 "Settled only a few centuries ago, the colony of [Root.Capital.GetName] has flourished beyond the most ambitious projections under the control of [Root.GetName].\n\nSince its founding, [Root.Capital.GetName] has been synonymous with cutting-edge technology, glamourous luxury and unconventional ideas that would never have taken root in more conservative parts of the galaxy; all the while managing to remain safe and profitable for those who invested countless credits into its success.\n\nBut if we are to avoid stagnancy and stay relevant on the galactic stage, we must expand the scope of our ambitions. There is a whole galaxy of opportunities waiting for us, but they won't be waiting forever if we leave the competition unchecked. We must seize the initiative - that is the only way forward."
