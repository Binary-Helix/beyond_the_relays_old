Aggressive and highly territorial, thresher maws feed by absorbing significant quantities of solar radiation. They also appear to consume minerals and ores from the ground itself for use in an unusual form of photosynthesis. This metabolic process, utilizing solar radiation and minerals as raw materials, creates the fuel that powers their various biological processes and allows them to move their significant mass with surprising speed. \n\nIt is unclear how these creatures survive in near-atmosphere less environments, or how exactly they breed. One junior researcher has theorized that they reproduce via spores that can lie dormant for millennia and are robust enough to survive prolonged periods in deep space and atmospheric re-entry.
