 tech_space_exploration:0 "Space Exploration"
 tech_space_exploration_desc:0 "The realization of faster-than-light travel is a new dawn for space exploration. Manned missions to other star systems are now not only possible, but necessary."
 tech_corvettes:0 "Corvettes"
 tech_corvettes_desc:0 "Usually used as policing, survey and picket ships by larger galactic navies, these small ships with crew under 10 are often pressed into combat by pirates and other rogue elements. While fast and maneuverable, they lack both firepower and protection for a real fight, being easy pickings for GARDIAN defences or fighter squadrons."
 tech_destroyers:0 "Frigates"
 tech_destroyers_desc:0 "Frigates are light escort and scouting vessels,often having extensive GARDIAN systems to provide anti-fighter screening for capital ships. Their most important role remains recon, with the fleet surrounding themselves with spheres of frigates scouting for incoming enemies. In fleet combat, frigates are organized into "wolf pack" flotillas of four to six. The wolf pack circle-strafes vulnerable targets, using their superior speed and maneuverability to evade return fire."
 tech_cruisers:0 "Cruisers"
 tech_cruisers_desc:0 "Cruisers are middle-weight combatants, faster than dreadnoughts, and more heavily-armed than frigates. Cruiser-weight starships are the standard combat unit encountered away from large naval bases, the "poor bloody infantry" of most fleets. Nimble scouting frigates have neither the punch nor the stamina to stand up to serious combat, and the mighty dreadnoughts are a strategic resource, carefully hoarded and committed to the most critical battles. In major fleet engagements, cruiser squadrons support the dreadnought battle line by screening their flanks against enemies attempting to maneuver for a main gun "bow shot" from their vulnerable broadsides."
 tech_battleships:0 "Dreadnoughts"
 tech_battleships_desc:0 "Dreadnoughts are kilometer-long capital ships mounting heavy, long-range weapons. They are only deployed for the most vital missions. A dreadnought's power lies in the length of its main gun. Dreadnoughts range from 800 meters to one kilometer long, with a main gun of commensurate length. Packed full with both mass accelerators and GARDIAN defences as well as possessing near impregnable armour & shields, engaging a dreadnought with anything other than another dreadnought is considered foolish. Proud flagships of their fleets, these warships besides their formidable tactical, strategic and political weight, often are symbols of their people."
 tech_titans:0 "Superdreadnoughts"
 tech_titans_desc:0 "A Superdreadnought is a warship of terrifying power, often rivalling that of entire fleets. Complemented by equally stunning protection and a crew of nearly ten thousand. These vessels are the terror of the stars, and even the strongest of foes would are given pause by their presence." 
 tech_colossus:0 "Colossi"
 tech_colossus_desc:0 "Advances in mega-engineering make blur the lines between reality and the fantastical, enabling the construction of Colossus-class military vessels that carry weapons capable of obliterating - or fundamentally altering - entire worlds, with the push of a button."

 tech_thrusters_3:0 "Antiproton Engines"
 tech_thrusters_3_desc:0 "In combat, military vessels require accelerations beyond the capability of fusion torches. Antiproton engines inject antiprotons into a reaction chamber filled with hydrogen. The matter-antimatter annihilation provides unmatched motive power. The drawback is fuel production; antiprotons must be manufactured one particle at a time. Most antimatter production is done at massive solar arrays orbiting energetic stars, making them high-value targets in wartime. "
 tech_thrusters_4:0 "Improved Reaction Control Systems"

 tech_mass_drivers_2:0 "Mass Accelerators"
 tech_mass_drivers_2_desc:0 "Mass accelerators propel solid metal slugs via electromagnetic attraction and repulsion. A slug lightened by a mass effect field can be accelerated to extremely high speeds, permitting previously unattainable projectile velocities."
 tech_mass_drivers_3:0 "Scram Rails"
 tech_mass_drivers_3_desc:0 "Scram rails greatly increase slug velocity of a mass accelerator, leading to both more destructive power as well as improved long range accuracy. Increase of heat generation, and resulting decrease of ROF is marginal compared to damage benefits."

A Multi-barreled, Spinally mounted, Behemoth, dreadnought devastator weapon, the Typhoeus fires multiple super heated metal alloy 'beams' at nearly light speed into hostile vessels. The sheer force of impact is enough to completely obliterate ships smaller than opposing dreadnaughts. The heat of the molten beams cut through starship armor like nothing else, and triggers mass overheating in all but the most thermally regulated warships.

Harnessing large heat radiators coupled along the warship, a series of diffusers transfers the building heat in a warship to “cook” a superheated projectile. This molten slag is then launched towards the enemy, coating hostile warships and dramatically exacerbating their thermal buildup. The increased heat generation either forces combatants to withdraw into FTL or be cooked alive in their ship."
