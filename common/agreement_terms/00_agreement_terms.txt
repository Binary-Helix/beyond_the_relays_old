# Agreement terms are the different terms that can be negotiated in Agreements, such as Subject Agreements.
# This file only defines which terms can be negotiated. The different options for the terms are defined in agreement_term_values scripts.

# Example:
#
# name_of_term = {
# 	# This defines how the term will show up in the UI. If it shows up as discrete/separate buttons or if it's a scale.
# 	# Supported values: discrete, discrete_number, specialist_type
# 	term_type = discrete 
# 	# Whether the term should show up on the agreement negotiation screen (default: no)
# 	hidden = yes/no
# }
